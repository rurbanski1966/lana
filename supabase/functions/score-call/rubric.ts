// Rubric assembly.
//
// The rubric itself is no longer here — it lives in public.scoring_rubrics and
// is edited from the app. This module turns a rubric row into the two things
// the model call needs: a system prompt and an output schema.
//
// There is deliberately NO built-in fallback rubric. If no active row exists,
// scoring fails loudly. A fallback would mean the app could display one set of
// criteria while a different set silently graded the calls — the exact bug
// that makes a score impossible to trust or reproduce.
//
// Assembly is DETERMINISTIC: fixed section order, fixed separators, no dates,
// no per-call values. That is what lets the prompt cache work — caching is a
// byte-exact prefix match, so the same rubric row must produce the same bytes
// every time. Reordering these sections would invalidate the cache on every
// call without changing a word of the rubric.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// BUILTIN_RUBRIC — used only when the database has no active rubric.
//
// This exists so scoring works before migration 004 is applied, and keeps
// working if the rubrics table is ever empty. It is NOT silent: the version
// string is prefixed `builtin/`, and that string is written to
// call_scores.rubric_version, so any score graded this way says so on its own
// row. A fallback you can't identify afterwards would be worse than no
// fallback — you could never tell which criteria produced a given score.
//
// The database rubric always wins when one is active. Edits made on the Rubric
// page therefore take effect immediately and this block stops being consulted.
// Keep the text here in sync with the seed in 004_rubric.sql, or the two paths
// will grade differently.

Do not infer facts that are not in the transcript. Transcripts are imperfect: speaker labels can be wrong and words are sometimes garbled. When a passage is ambiguous, say so in the rationale and score conservatively rather than assuming the worse reading. Never report a compliance finding that rests on a garbled passage.`,
  output_guidance:
`The bulleted criteria under each dimension are the specific behaviours to look for. They are a guide to what good looks like, not a checklist to tally — a call can score well while missing a bullet that did not apply, and can score badly while technically hitting several. Judge the dimension, and use the bullets to explain why.

Where a dimension carries a weight above 1, it matters proportionally more to the overall score.

\`overall_score\` is your holistic judgment of the call, not an average of the dimensions — weight what actually mattered here, informed by the dimension weights. Keep it 0-100.

\`summary\` is two or three sentences a manager can read without opening the transcript. \`coaching_focus\` is the single highest-leverage thing this agent should work on next; name one thing, not a list.`,
