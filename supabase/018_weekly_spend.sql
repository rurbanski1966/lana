-- ============================================================================
-- Lana — migration 018: weekly spend on the agent dashboard
--
-- Additive. Run after 017. Safe to re-run.
--
-- Adds weekly_spend to my_metrics(): every call scored this week (Monday
-- through Sunday, America/Chicago — same week convention as spend_summary())
-- counts, org-wide, same "everyone's calls count" rule Daily spend uses —
-- not scoped to agent_id = auth.uid().
--
-- New return column, so this has to DROP the function first — CREATE OR
-- REPLACE can't change a function's return signature (same reason migration
-- 015 needed it).
